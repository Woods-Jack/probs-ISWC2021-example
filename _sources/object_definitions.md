Object definitions
==================

Here are just a few example object types which we might be interested in modelling.

```{system:object} Aggregates
:become_parent: true
```

```{system:object} CrushedStone
:label: Crushed stone
```

```{system:object} SandAndGravel
:label: Sand & Gravel
```

```{end-sub-objects}
```
